Description: ModViz POP is an interactive and dynamic visualization tool 
    developed for simulating differential equation based population PK/PD 
    models with variability. It has an in built PK/PD ODE library of models
    to choose from alongside ability to plug in a user defined model from 
    local or project directory. The user interface consists of several key 
    inputs for performing the simulations as well as options to visualize the 
    plots, input parameters, derived values and equations. It also provides 
    the ability to download the underlying model, plots, simulated data or a 
    comprehensive report consisting of all the key inputs and outputs of the 
    simulations. The interface includes advanced features where users can overlay 
    external data on a simulation, set a certain simulation scenario as a 
    reference or carry out sensitivity analysis based simulations. This easy to 
    use interface can serve as a valuable tool to project teams to evaluate 
    potential scenarios facilitating collaborative decision making in the drug 
    discovery and development paradigm.
